# Pokedex
Pokédex Data Analysis (Pandas + NumPy + Matplotlib)
A Pokémon Pokédex project built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal is to practice real-world data analysis by loading a Pokémon stats dataset, cleaning it, analyzing it, and exploring it through an interactive menu and visualizations.

FEATURES:
Loads Pokémon data from pokemon.csv into a Pandas DataFrame and cleans missing values in the secondary type column.​
Computes derived stats such as total_stats (sum of HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) using NumPy.​
Calculates a custom power_score using a weighted combination of base stats.
Interactive CLI menu to view top Pokémon, type averages, power rankings, and search by name.
Matplotlib visualizations for exploring stats distributions and relationships between stats.
